// Exploitability Metrics
//
// As mentioned, the Exploitability metrics reflect the characteristics of the thing
// that is vulnerable, which we refer to formally as the vulnerable component.
// Therefore, each of the Exploitability metrics listed below should be scored relative
// to the vulnerable component, and reflect the properties of the vulnerability that
// lead to a successful attack.

// This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is
// possible. This metric value (and consequently the Base score) will be larger
// the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to
// exploit the vulnerable component. The assumption is that the number of potential
// attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across the Internet
// is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability
// requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater score.
enum AttackVector {
  ATTACK_VECTOR_INVALID = 0;
  ATTACK_VECTOR_UNDEFINED = 1;
  // A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable component
  // is bound to the network stack and the attacker's path is through OSI layer 3
  // (the network layer). Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable"
  // and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable one or more network hops
  // away (e.g. across layer 3 boundaries from routers). An example of a network attack
  // is an attacker causing a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted
  // TCP packet from across the public Internet (e.g. CVE 2004 0230).
  ATTACK_VECTOR_NETWORK = 2;
  // A vulnerability exploitable with adjacent network access means the vulnerable
  // component is bound to the network stack, however the attack is limited to the
  // same shared physical (e.g. Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11), or logical (e.g. local IP subnet)
  // network, and cannot be performed across an OSI layer 3 boundary (e.g. a router).
  // An example of an Adjacent attack would be an ARP (IPv4) or neighbor discovery (IPv6)
  // flood leading to a denial of service on the local LAN segment. See also CVE 2013 6014.

  // the vulnerability, otherwise, she may rely on User Interaction to execute a malicious file.
  ATTACK_VECTOR_LOCAL = 4;
  // A vulnerability exploitable with Physical access requires the attacker to physically
  // touch or manipulate the vulnerable component. Physical interaction may be brief
  // (e.g. evil maid attack [1]) or persistent. An example of such an attack is a cold boot

// the assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in
// order to exploit the vulnerability (such conditions are captured in the User
// Interaction metric). This metric value is largest for the least complex attacks.

  // That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires
  // the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation
  // or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can
  // be expected. 2 For example, a successful attack may depend on an attacker
  // overcoming any of the following conditions:
  // - The attacker must conduct target-specific reconnaissance. For example, on
  //   target configuration settings, sequence numbers, shared secrets, etc.
  // - The attacker must prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability.
  //   For example, repeated exploitation to win a race condition, or overcoming
  //   advanced exploit mitigation techniques.
  // - The attacker must inject herself into the logical network path between the
  //   target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or
  //   modify network communications (e.g. man in the middle attack).

// outcome that is most directly and predictably associated with a successful
// attack. That is, analysts should constrain impacts to a reasonable, final
// outcome which they are confident an attacker is able to achieve.

// This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information
// resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited
// vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and
// disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or
// disclosure to, unauthorized ones. This metric value increases with the
// degree of loss to the impacted component.

// refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a
// networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to
// the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network
// bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an

  // Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability,
  // but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to
  // the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing
  // connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly
